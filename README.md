NEON AOP Hyperspectral Trait Models

(1) NEON fresh leaf spectra trait models: PLSR models to predict leaf chlorophylls, carotenoids and phenolics using the ASD FieldSpec3 measured fresh leaf spectra. 

(2) NEON dry leaf spectra trait modesl: PLSR models to predict foliar traits such as carbon, nitrogen, etc. using the ASD FieldSpec3 measured dry leaf spectra. 

(3) NEON image trait models: PLSR models to predict foliar traits using NEON AOP canopy spectra.
